# MyGymBuddy

Needed something to keep my gym routine. I know there are plenty apps, not sure why I was looking for something very simple. So, happily vibe coded ;)

## How to run locally

1. Install Node.js (v18+ recommended).
2. In the project root, run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server (Vite). Open `http://localhost:5173` by default.
4. To build: `npm run build`. To preview the build: `npm run preview`.
